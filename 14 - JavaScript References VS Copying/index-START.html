     name = 'west';
     console.log(name, name2);
     // west wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // this is actually a reference!!!

    console.log(players, team);
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    //updating an array will always reference back. changing the reference(team) will change the original(players).

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); //makes copy of original array    

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //!!!this is a reference NOT a copy
    const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99; // this changes the original(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person,{number: 10, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
